    intro:
      "Hello there! I'm Praise, a self-taught software developer from the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria. I'm passionate about crafting digital solutions that make a difference.",
    par1: "My journey into the world of tech kicked off in 2019 when I attended an Oil & Gas Pros conference (strange, right? - btw, I'm a geology grad) and was captivated by the capabilities of AR in Oil and Gas. That moment ignited a spark of curiosity in me, and let's just say, it's been a wild ride since then.",
    par2: "Fast forward to 2021, and that initial curiosity has turned into a full-blown passion. I found this amazing space where creativity and problem-solving collide, thanks to the magic of coding. The possibilities seemed limitless, and I was hooked. The challenges of being self-taught haven't stopped me because my love for development runs deep. I genuinely believe that technology has the power to change lives.",
    par3: "So, here I am, having worn a few hats along the way. I've freelanced for a B2B company, worked at a digital consultancy startup, and currently enjoying the thrill of working with a top 5 cryptocurrency exchange in Nigeria, where I've contributed in building some amazing products such as a crypto academy platform and it's admin dashboard, an internal CSS library, data visualization tool, responsive websites, etc",
    par4: "I'm very dedicated to learning, and that's been my not-so-secret weapon. So, let me spill the beans on my current tech crushes. I'm diving into the world of web3 and blockchain technology, getting cozy with DSA, and a bunch of other cool stuff. Learning is my jam, and I'm always hungry for that next byte of knowledge! ðŸš€",
    par5: "I love challenges, especially the ones that involve building cool stuff on the web! I'm always up for a coding adventure. Think we could build something together? Shoot me an email, and let's make some digital magic happen! ðŸš€âœ¨",
